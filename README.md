# FlashCards

## Overview

This game of FlashCards will help any new developer brush up on their knowledge by answering multi-choice questions and receiving feedback as they go!

## Built Using Test Driven Development
This game was created using Test Driven Development by creating the test files before actually writing the game code itself.  

All of the test files can be seen in the `test` directory in the repo.

If you want to see how the tests work you can run `npm test` in your terminal after completing the setup below.

## Setup

Clone down the repo to play the game.

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
## Playing the Game

Running `node index.js` from the root of the project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```
You will see --->
```bash
Your project is running...
```


The game will begin by prompting you with a question which you can answer by pressing the corresponding number and then enter!

After answering each question, pressing enter will prompt you if your answer was either incorrect or correct and bring up the next question.

Once you have answered all of the cards it will give you a percentage of correctly answered questions and then end the game.

## Future Features
Report Card: At the end of the game, create a report card that would detail any answers that the user got wrong as well as how many tries each question took.

Timer: At the end of the game, create a report card that would detail any answers that the user got wrong as well as how many tries each question took.
